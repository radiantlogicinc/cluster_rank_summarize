# CLUSTER_7 Analysis

### Analysis of the Cluster

#### 1. Significance of Common Columns and Their Values
The cluster is defined by two common columns: `marital_status` and `religion`. All 3 rows in the cluster share the values:
- **marital_status**: "MARRIED" (100% consistency)
- **religion**: "CATHOLIC" (100% consistency)

These commonalities suggest that the cluster represents a highly homogeneous group of married, Catholic individuals. The consistency in these columns implies they are strong defining features of the cluster.

Other notable value distributions:
- **admission_type**: Dominated by "EMERGENCY" (2 out of 3 rows), indicating urgent/acute care needs.
- **ethnicity**: "WHITE" appears in 2 out of 3 rows, suggesting a potential racial/ethnic trend.
- **insurance**: Only 1 row has "Medicare," but this may reflect the older age of the cohort (common for Medicare recipients).

#### 2. Detailed Analysis of Each Itemset
The cluster contains 3 itemsets, each highlighting different combinations of features:

- **Itemset 19**:  
  - Key features: "EMERGENCY" admission, "EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT" location, "MARRIED," and "CATHOLIC."  
  - Covers 66.7% of the cluster's rows.  
  - Suggests a subgroup of married Catholic patients admitted urgently through the ER.  

- **Itemset 20**:  
  - Key features: "WHITE" ethnicity, "Medicare" insurance, "MARRIED," and "CATHOLIC."  
  - Also covers 66.7% of the cluster.  
  - Indicates a subgroup of white, married Catholic patients likely aged 65+ (given Medicare).  

- **Itemset 25**:  
  - Key features: "WHITE" ethnicity, "EMERGENCY" admission, "MARRIED," and "CATHOLIC."  
  - Covers 61.9% of the cluster.  
  - Overlaps with Itemsets 19 and 20, reinforcing the dominance of white, married Catholic patients with emergency admissions.  

#### 3. Unique Aspects of the Cluster
- **Homogeneity**: Unusually high consistency in marital status and religion (100% for both).  
- **Emergency Admissions**: Most rows involve emergency admissions, suggesting acute care needs.  
- **Ethnicity and Insurance**: While not universal, "WHITE" and "Medicare" appear frequently, hinting at demographic trends.  
- **Limited Diversity**: Only 3 rows, but the strong overlap in itemsets suggests a very specific patient profile.  

#### Summary
- All patients are married and Catholic, with emergency admissions being common.  
- White ethnicity and Medicare insurance appear frequently, indicating potential age/demographic trends.  
- The cluster represents a small but highly homogeneous group with acute care needs.
