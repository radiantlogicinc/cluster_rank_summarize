# CLUSTER_8 Analysis

### Analysis of the Cluster

#### 1. Significance of Common Columns and Their Values
The cluster is defined by 5 common columns:  
- **admission_location**: Both patients were admitted via "EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT," indicating urgent care needs.  
- **admission_type**: Both had "EMERGENCY" admissions, reinforcing the urgency of their cases.  
- **ethnicity**: Both patients are "WHITE," suggesting a potential demographic bias or homogeneity in this cluster.  
- **hospital_expire_flag**: Both have a value of "0," meaning neither died during hospitalization.  
- **insurance**: Both are covered by "Medicare," highlighting a shared financial/insurance profile.  

These commonalities suggest a subgroup of elderly (Medicare-covered) White patients admitted emergently but surviving hospitalization.

#### 2. Detailed Analysis of Each Itemset
- **Itemset 2**:  
  - **Key traits**: All common columns plus "discharge_location" = "SNF" (Skilled Nursing Facility).  
  - **Interpretation**: The majority (70.8%) of rows in this cluster involve patients discharged to SNF, implying post-hospitalization rehabilitation or long-term care needs. This aligns with Medicare coverage (often for older adults) and non-fatal outcomes.  
  - **Example rows**: Consistent across multiple rows (e.g., IDs 12269, 12280), indicating robustness.  

- **Itemset 8**:  
  - **Key traits**: Adds "religion" = "CATHOLIC" but lacks discharge location.  
  - **Interpretation**: 54.2% of rows include Catholic patients, suggesting a religious demographic link. The absence of discharge location hints at variability in post-hospital care for this subgroup.  
  - **Example rows**: Overlaps with Itemset 2 (e.g., IDs 12269, 12283), showing partial overlap in patient profiles.  

#### 3. Unique Aspects of the Cluster
- **Demographic homogeneity**: All patients are White, Medicare-insured, and admitted emergently.  
- **Outcome consistency**: No fatalities (hospital_expire_flag=0), but divergent discharge locations (SNF vs. unknown).  
- **Partial religious overlap**: Only one itemset includes religion, suggesting itâ€™s a secondary clustering factor.  

#### Summary  
- Elderly (Medicare-covered) White patients admitted emergently, all surviving hospitalization.  
- Majority discharged to SNF, with a subset identifying as Catholic.
