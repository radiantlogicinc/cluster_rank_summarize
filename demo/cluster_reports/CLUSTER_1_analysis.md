# CLUSTER_1 Analysis

### Analysis of the Cluster

#### 1. Significance of Common Columns and Their Values
- **Insurance**: The cluster is entirely composed of patients with "Private" insurance (100% coverage). This is the only common column across all itemsets, indicating that private insurance is a defining feature of this cluster.
- **Ethnicity**: "WHITE" is the dominant ethnicity (3 out of 5 rows, or 60% of the cluster's rows where ethnicity is specified). This suggests a potential demographic skew.
- **Hospital_expire_flag**: The value "0" (indicating the patient did not expire in the hospital) appears in 2 out of 5 rows (40% of the cluster's rows where this flag is specified). This could imply lower mortality rates for this group.
- **Admission_type**: "EMERGENCY" is the most frequent admission type (3 out of 5 rows, or 60% of the cluster's rows where admission type is specified), suggesting acute care needs.
- **Admission_location**: Only one row specifies "EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT," which aligns with the emergency admission type but is not pervasive.
- **Language**: "ENGL" (English) appears in one row, but its low frequency makes it less significant for the cluster as a whole.

#### 2. Detailed Analysis of Each Itemset
- **Itemset 32**: Combines "Private" insurance, "0" hospital_expire_flag, and "WHITE" ethnicity. This itemset covers 68.18% of the cluster's rows, suggesting a strong association between these attributes. The high matching percentage indicates that privately insured, White patients who survive hospitalization are a dominant subgroup.
- **Itemset 33**: Links "Private" insurance, "EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT" location, and "EMERGENCY" admission type. Also covers 68.18% of rows, highlighting that emergency admissions are common among privately insured patients, though the admission location is less consistent.
- **Itemset 37**: Combines "Private" insurance, "0" hospital_expire_flag, and "EMERGENCY" admission type. Covers 63.64% of rows, reinforcing the trend of non-expiring emergency admissions among privately insured patients.
- **Itemset 39**: Pairs "Private" insurance, "WHITE" ethnicity, and "EMERGENCY" admission type. Covers 63.64% of rows, suggesting that White, privately insured patients frequently present as emergencies.
- **Itemset 43**: Includes "Private" insurance, "ENGL" language, and "WHITE" ethnicity. Covers 59.09% of rows, indicating that English-speaking, White, privately insured patients are another notable subgroup.

#### 3. Unique Aspects That Distinguish This Cluster
- **Homogeneous Insurance**: All patients have private insurance, which distinguishes this cluster from others that might include Medicare, Medicaid, or Government-insured patients.
- **Ethnicity Skew**: The prominence of "WHITE" ethnicity suggests a potential demographic bias or sampling artifact.
- **Emergency Admissions Dominance**: The high frequency of "EMERGENCY" admission type contrasts with clusters where elective or urgent admissions might prevail.
- **Low Mortality**: The presence of "0" in hospital_expire_flag (where specified) hints at better outcomes or less severe conditions compared to clusters with higher mortality flags.

#### Summary
- All patients in this cluster have private insurance, with a majority being White and admitted as emergencies.  
- The cluster shows low mortality rates and a tendency for emergency room admissions among privately insured individuals.  
- Demographic and admission patterns suggest a distinct subgroup within the dataset.
