# CLUSTER_3 Analysis

### Analysis of the Cluster

#### 1. Significance of Common Columns and Their Values
The cluster is defined by three common columns: `admission_type`, `discharge_location`, and `hospital_expire_flag`. These columns are highly significant because they reveal a consistent pattern:
- **`admission_type`: All 4 rows in the cluster are "EMERGENCY," indicating these patients were admitted under urgent circumstances.
- **`discharge_location`: All 4 rows are "DEAD/EXPIRED," meaning these patients died during their hospital stay.
- **`hospital_expire_flag`: All 4 rows have a value of "1," confirming the mortality outcome.

These commonalities suggest this cluster represents **emergency admissions that resulted in patient mortality**. The uniformity in these columns highlights a critical subset of the dataset: patients who did not survive their hospital stay after emergency admission.

#### 2. Detailed Analysis of Each Itemset
The cluster contains four itemsets, each revealing additional dimensions of the data:

- **Itemset 3**:  
  - **Key columns**: `ethnicity` ("WHITE"), `insurance` ("Medicare"), `admission_location` ("EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT").  
  - **Coverage**: 59.26% of the cluster rows.  
  - **Insight**: This itemset suggests that a majority of these deceased emergency patients were White, covered by Medicare, and admitted directly through the emergency room. Medicare coverage may indicate older age, which could correlate with higher mortality risk.

- **Itemset 16**:  
  - **Key columns**: `ethnicity` ("WHITE"), `language` ("ENGL").  
  - **Coverage**: 48.15% of the cluster rows.  
  - **Insight**: Reinforces the predominance of White, English-speaking patients in this cluster, possibly reflecting demographic trends in the dataset or healthcare disparities.

- **Itemset 17**:  
  - **Key columns**: `insurance` ("Medicare"), `language` ("ENGL").  
  - **Coverage**: 48.15% of the cluster rows.  
  - **Insight**: Overlaps with Itemset 3 but emphasizes the role of Medicare and English language, suggesting a potential link between insurance type (Medicare) and outcomes in emergency scenarios.

- **Itemset 24**:  
  - **Key columns**: `marital_status` ("MARRIED").  
  - **Coverage**: 48.15% of the cluster rows.  
  - **Insight**: A subset of these patients were married, which could be relevant for studying social support's impact on outcomes (though the sample size is small).

#### 3. Unique Aspects of the Cluster
- **Uniform mortality outcome**: Every row in the cluster shares the same discharge location ("DEAD/EXPIRED") and expire flag ("1"), making this a distinct "mortality cluster."  
- **Emergency admissions**: All admissions were emergencies, distinguishing this cluster from elective or urgent admissions.  
- **Demographic hints**: While not universal, White ethnicity, Medicare insurance, and English language appear frequently, suggesting these factors may be overrepresented in this high-risk group.  
- **Partial overlap in itemsets**: The itemsets share some columns (e.g., `ethnicity`, `insurance`) but not all, indicating diversity within the cluster despite the core commonality of emergency mortality.

#### Summary
- **All patients died after emergency admission**, with no survivors in the cluster.  
- **Demographics skew toward White, Medicare-covered, English-speaking patients**, though not universally.  
- **Itemsets reveal subgroups**, such as married patients or those admitted via the ER, within the broader mortality pattern.
