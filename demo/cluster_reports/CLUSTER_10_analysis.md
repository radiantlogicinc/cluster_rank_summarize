# CLUSTER_10 Analysis

### Analysis of the Cluster

#### 1. Significance of Common Columns and Their Values
- **Common Column**: The only common column across the cluster is `insurance`, with all 2 rows having the value "Private." This suggests that patients in this cluster are uniformly covered by private insurance, which may indicate a specific demographic or socioeconomic group.
- **Other Columns**: The cluster also includes `marital_status` and `religion`, but these are not common across all rows. The values "SINGLE" (for `marital_status`) and "CATHOLIC" (for `religion`) appear in one row each, indicating some diversity within the cluster.

#### 2. Detailed Analysis of Each Itemset
- **Itemset 46**: This itemset combines `insurance = "Private"` and `marital_status = "SINGLE"`. It covers 81.25% of the cluster's rows (13 out of 16), suggesting a strong association between private insurance and single marital status in this subset. The high row coverage indicates this is a dominant pattern within the cluster.
- **Itemset 48**: This itemset combines `insurance = "Private"` and `religion = "CATHOLIC"`. Like Itemset 46, it also covers 81.25% of the cluster's rows, indicating another strong associationâ€”this time between private insurance and Catholic religion. The overlapping row coverage with Itemset 46 suggests that many patients are both single and Catholic.

#### 3. Unique Aspects That Distinguish This Cluster
- **Uniform Insurance**: The cluster is entirely composed of patients with private insurance, distinguishing it from clusters with mixed or public insurance (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid).
- **Partial Homogeneity in Other Attributes**: While `marital_status` and `religion` are not uniform, the high coverage of "SINGLE" and "CATHOLIC" suggests these are prominent secondary traits. The cluster is not fully homogeneous but has strong sub-patterns.
- **Small Size but High Coverage**: Despite having only 2 rows, the itemsets cover a large proportion (81.25%) of the cluster's rows, indicating that the patterns are highly representative.

#### Summary
- All patients in this cluster have private insurance.
- Most patients are either single or Catholic, with significant overlap between these traits.
